# Power-BI-Dashboards
Welcome to my Power BI Dashboards repository. As an aspiring data analyst, I created these dashboards as part of my learning journey with Power BI.
This collection highlights my progress and the practical skills I've developed in data visualization and analysis.

Each dashboard in this repository represents a step forward in my understanding of Power BI's capabilities, from basic charting techniques to more advanced data modeling and reporting.
While these projects were created during my learning phase, they reflect my dedication to mastering the tools and techniques that are crucial for a data analyst role.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work as I continue to build my skills and work towards a career in data analysis.
